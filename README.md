# UCSD Purity Test

A web application built to measure how much students at UC San Diego have explored different aspects of campus life, social experiences, and personal milestones based on a fun and anonymous quiz format inspired by the Rice Purity Test.

## Overview

**UCSD Purity Test** is a React-based web application that presents users with a series of questions designed to gauge their experiences at UCSD. Once completed, users receive a "purity score" that reflects how much they’ve done (or not done) during their time there.

This project blends a lighthearted quiz format with sleek, modern UI elements, making it a fun and engaging way for Tritons to reflect and share their UCSD experiences.
